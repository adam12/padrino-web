title: Padrino 0.13.0 - Mustermann Router, Performance Enhancements, Streaming Support, and Much More
---

Padrino 0.12.4 was shipped on October 19th 2014. Hard to believe that just about a year has flown by since then as we have been working towards our next major release of Padrino. While there have been betas available for some time, we are excited to announce the final release of Padrino 0.13.0! This version has a huge host of improvements and upgrades, both big and small.

This 0.13.0 release brings several major changes and updates including a completely redesigned router, significant performance enhancements, streaming support, bug fixes and a ton of code cleanup. Full details for this release are below. You should also check out the [0.13.0 upgrade guide](http://www.padrinorb.com/blog/upgrading-padrino-from-0-12-x-to-0-13-0-guide) as well for a detailed look at moving up from 0.12.X.

Redesigned Mustermann Router
----------------------------

One of the big changes in this release was the retirement of [http_router](https://github.com/joshbuddy/http_router) which is no longer being maintained. We have switched to a brand new router written by [@namusyaka](https://github.com/namusyaka). The older router had accrued significant technical debt with many hacks and workarounds introduced along with thread-safety issues. We’ve been working on this redesigned router for quite sometime, running [router benchmarks](https://github.com/padrino/padrino-framework/pull/1692) and making sure we took our time to ensure a smooth replacement. We are proud to unveil the new router with this release and you can [read more details in this PR](https://github.com/padrino/padrino-framework/pull/1800).

Project-wide Configuration
--------------------------

With 0.13.0 comes project-wide global configuration options with environment support. This is inspired by the Sinatra configuration system but is project-wide rather than app-specific. Configuration can be done anywhere in your project including `config/apps.rb`:

~~~ruby
Padrino.config.value1 = 42

Padrino.configure :development do |config|
  config.value2 = ‘only development’
end

Padrino.configure :development, :production do |config|
  config.value2 = ‘both development and production’
end

Padrino.configure do |config|
  config.value2 = ‘any environment’
end
~~~

and then these values can be accessed with:

~~~ruby
Padrino.config.value1 # => 42
Padrino.config.value2 # => 'any environment'
~~~

Thanks to [@ujifgc](https://github.com/ujifgc) for implementing this. More details can [be found in the PR](https://github.com/padrino/padrino-framework/pull/1909).

Sinatra Upgrades
----------------

In this release, we have upgraded Sinatra to the latest 1.4.6 release which allowed us to clean up several previous workarounds. The result is an even cleaner integration with Sinatra. This includes the following Sinatra compatibility improvements:

* FIX [Remove temporary `show_exceptions` code](https://github.com/padrino/padrino-framework/pull/1899)
* FIX [#1867](https://github.com/padrino/padrino-framework/issues/1867) Update ShowExceptions to suit latest rack master ([@namusyaka](https://github.com/namusyaka))
* FIX [#1950](https://github.com/padrino/padrino-framework/issues/1950) Padrino now follows Sinatra’s charset policy ([@ujifgc](https://github.com/ujifgc))
* FIX [Sinatra async streaming callbacks](https://github.com/padrino/padrino-framework/issues/1704)
* FIX [#1880](https://github.com/padrino/padrino-framework/issues/1880) rendering issue by accepting string content types ([@ujifgc](https://github.com/ujifgc))
* FIX [#1942](https://github.com/padrino/padrino-framework/issues/1942) maintain Sinatra params indifference ([@ujifgc](https://github.com/ujifgc))

We are committed to compatibility with our Sinatra core and this release marks a solid step forward in that regard.

Performance Improvements
------------------------

We are committed to making Padrino as lightweight and comparable to raw Sinatra speed as possible. In that vein, we have made the following improvements:

* NEW [#1857](https://github.com/padrino/padrino-framework/issues/1857) Precompile routes when loading Padrino ([@namusyaka](https://github.com/namusyaka))
* FIX [#1792](https://github.com/padrino/padrino-framework/issues/1792) Faster code using reverse_each to iterate gems ([@glaucocustodio](https://github.com/glaucocustodio))
* FIX [#1793](https://github.com/padrino/padrino-framework/issues/1793) Faster codeusing #sub instead of #gsub ([@glaucocustodio](https://github.com/glaucocustodio))
* FIX [#1959](https://github.com/padrino/padrino-framework/issues/1959) simplify the mounter class ([@dnesteryuk](https://github.com/dnesteryuk))

We’ve also introduced a benchmark test suite to test speed for padrino core and router:

- NEW [#1966](https://github.com/padrino/padrino-framework/issues/1966) sample benchmark test of padrino core ([@ujifgc](https://github.com/ujifgc))

This should help us in making continued improvements going forward.
